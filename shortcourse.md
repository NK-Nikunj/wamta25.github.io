Short course: Modern STL Basics

This 1.5 day short course will be given by [Nicolai Josuttis](http://www.josuttis.de/).
Nicolai Josuttis is a member of the C++ Standard Committee for
over 20 years and the author of four C++ books, e.g. The C++ Standard Library - A Tutorial and Reference; C++20 - The Complete Guide;
C++17 - The Complete Guide; and C++ Move Semantics - The Complete Guide.

In the course participants will learn the following:

Modern STL Basics:

     - Algorithms (e.g. the various sorts() algorithms we have and why)

     - Data structures including unordered containers

     - Iterators (and why raw pointers can be used like them)

Then on top of that:

   - Lambdas (and "callables" for algorithms, maybe including function objects)

   - Iterators categories and why raw pointers work for iterators

   - How generic programming helps (incl. how std::array is implemented)

   - Parallel algorithms

   - C++20 Ranges and  views (and how views compromise certain C++/STL principles)
